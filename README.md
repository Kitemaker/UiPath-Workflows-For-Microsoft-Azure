UiPath Workflow Snippets for Microsoft Azure activities
Inspiration
Creating Azure Object e.g. Resource group, Service Plan and Web App requires many steps and also to be managed regularly. Using these workflows I am giving how we can utilise UiPath integration with Powershell to automate Azure activities. It is just starting point , by learning from these workflows users can automate unlimited tasks and efficiently handle Azure Infrastructure management

# What it does
These workflows use Azure Powershell SDK and create azure components e.g. WebApp, Resource Group and App Service Plan

# How I built it
By using Azure Powershell SDK and Poweshell App Integration of UiPAth

# Challenges I ran into
Converting Object received from Powershell and setting correct arguments for powershell commands

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
First integration of Microsoft Azure with UiPath , it can open gate for opportunities for Infrastructure automation using UiPath

# What I learned
Invoking Powershell using UiPath

# What's next for UiPath Workflow for Microsoft Azure
Generating Metrics , Virtual Machine Controls, User Management etc.
